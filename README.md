# SpringBoard_General

Hello!  Welcome to my little project space where I can submit documents and code publicly so I can be judged by the World!  Please be nice!  This repository is mainly for work done during the Foundation of Data Science course run by Springboard.

Here you will find my answers to the Springboard mini projects including:

1) My initial capstone ideas ("LMS_Capstone_Project_Ideas.txt")
2) Code for Titanic exercise ("Titanic.R")
3) Code for CHIS exercise ("CRIS.R")

As new projects are submitted this readme will be updated.  All other files not listed here but found in this repository are unfinished pieces of work in the making which will eventually be officially listed above.

Thank you for your time!  Enjoy!
